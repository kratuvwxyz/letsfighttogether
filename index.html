                    <h4>Coronavirus (COVID-19)</h4>
                    <p><strong>COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways.</strong> It's caused by a virus called Coronavirus, which has not been previously identified in humans. The disease was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in the 2019–2021 coronavirus pandemic.</p>
                    <p>Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. The disease can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death in more severe cases.</p>
                    <p>Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.</p>

                  <h4>What are coronaviruses?</h4>
                  <p>The first symptoms of COVID-19 and influenza (flu) infections are often very similar. They both cause fever and similar respiratory symptoms, which can then range from mild through to severe disease, and sometimes can be fatal.</p>
                  <p>Both viruses are also transmitted in the same way, by coughing or sneezing, or by contact with hands, surfaces or objects contaminated with the virus. As a result, the same public health measures, such as hand hygiene (hand washing), good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into a tissue and immediately disposing of the tissue) and good household cleaning are important actions to prevent both infections.</p>
                  <p>The speed of transmission is an important difference between the two viruses. Influenza typically has a shorter incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) than COVID-19. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19.</p>
                  <p>While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be higher for COVID-19. While most people have mild symptoms, approximately 15% of people have severe infections and 5% require intensive care in a hospital ICU. The proportions of severe and critical COVID-19 infections are higher than for influenza infections.</p>

                  <p>The speed of transmission is an important difference between the two viruses. Influenza typically has a shorter incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) than COVID-19. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19.</p>
                  <p>While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be higher for COVID-19. While most people have mild symptoms, approximately 15% of people have severe infections and 5% require intensive care in a hospital ICU. The proportions of severe and critical COVID-19 infections are higher than for influenza infections.</p>

                <p>The Coronavirus, or COVID-19, continues to spread rapidly across international borders. It has now reached countries with weak health systems which are less prepared to combat the disease. This outbreak will hit vulnerable populations and those living in crisis the hardest.</p>
                <h6 style="line-height: 30px">Many health teams work around the clock to rapidly detect, respond, and prevent the further spread of the disease. Their main challenge is to educate people about the disease. Our creative and marketing teams work together to create materials that help many organizations to educate communities.</h6>
                <p>Please make an immediate donation to maintain our programs and help us contain the coronavirus outbreak. Your gift will help us reach families in coronavirus-affected areas and support our work worldwide.</p>
